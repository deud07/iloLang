# Ilo - A simple demonstration of the future of code.
----------
## Description
Ilo is a simple and fast, lightweight interpreted programming language that can be used for scripting or modification.

You can use Ilo the same way as you would use [Lua](https://https://www.lua.org/) in applications. However, Ilo is a lot simpler and more flexible than Lua as it allows for object-oriented programming and faster compilation times.

## Features
As of now, Ilo supports the following features:
- Printing to command line
- Simple arithmetic
- C/C++ implementation.

### Feel free to add your own features and fork it yourself!
